# mysql-parallel-restore
MySQL - Restore of many tables dumped from mysqldump

When we have a database that has many big tables and it restore locks the restore of tiny and other big tables due mysqldump output being serial. A good deal is to make backup by table separatelly.
But the restore process may be a boring hand work. So this code will do a parallel restore of this lot of files generated by another by tables hand backup.

- It's better if running localhost.
- Recommended smart use of parallelism (due the disk and cpu resources)
- The mysql-restore.py depends on customLogger.py
- The connection configs have to be placed on the script.
- You should create the logs directories before running the script.
